        <h2> Description</h2>
        <p>The AirPods 4 mark a significant evolution in Apple's standard-earbud line. Built around the powerful H2 headphone chip, they're designed to deliver richer, more immersive sound, smoother integration with Apple devices, and smarter capabilities than before. </p>
        <p> Here are some of the <b>features:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Immersive, theatre-like sound:</b> With a custom high-excursion driver and high dynamic range amplifier, these earbuds are built to deliver deeper bass, clearer mids and highs, and an overall more refined audio profile.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Personalised Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking:</b> You get a three-dimensional soundscape, the effect is that audio feels like it's coming from around you rather than inside your head. Great for music, shows, gaming. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Smarter and clearer calls:</b> With features like Voice Isolation (which reduces background noise) and advanced beamforming mics, the AirPods 4 are optimized for real-world environments.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Refined design and comfort:</b> The shape has been re-worked for better fit and stability, with a shorter stem and a refined contour to make them comfortable for all-day use.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Two variants to choose from:</b> The standard model, and a version with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). The ANC version brings a premium level of noise control even though the design remains open-fit.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Smaller, smarter charging case:</b> he case is more compact (over 10% smaller by volume compared to previous generations), supports USB-C charging, and for the ANC model also supports wireless charging and integrates a speaker for Find My features.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Built for everyday ruggedness:</b> Rated IP54 for dust, sweat and water resistance, suitable for workouts, commuters, daily use.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Battery life:</b> 
                <ul>
                 <li> Up to 30 hours of listening time with the case</li>
                 <li> Up to 5 hours of listening time on a single charge</li>
                 <li> Up to 4 hours of listening time with Active Noise Cancellation on a single charge </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>An instant connection:</b> AirPods 4 pair immediately with every device connected to your Apple Account. Just place AirPods near your iPhone or iPad and tap Connect.
            </li>
